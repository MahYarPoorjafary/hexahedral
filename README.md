# Hexahedral

This is my submission to the 2016 [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/).
Play the game by visiting http://matthewminer.com/ggj2016.

Push down all the blocks in the minimum number of moves. Exciting? Hoo boy, you
bet your sweet granddaddy it is.

Play in your browser of choice. It works on mobile, but hasn't been especially
well optimized for it.


## Controls

To move your cube you can either use the arrow keys (admittedly a bit awkward
due to the isometric projection), or you can click on an adjacent pink or
blue cube.
