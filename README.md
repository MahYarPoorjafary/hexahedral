Push down all the blocks in the minimum number of moves. Exciting? Hoo boy, you
bet your sweet granddaddy it is.

Play in your browser of choice. It works on mobile, but hasn't been especially
well optimized for it.


## Controls

To move your cube either use the arrow keys (admittedly a bit awkward due to
the isometric projection), or click on an adjacent pink or blue cube.


## Development

After cloning the repository, run the following.

    npm install
    npm start

Then open *build/index.html* in your browser.
